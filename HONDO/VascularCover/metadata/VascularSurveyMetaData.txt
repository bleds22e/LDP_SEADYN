Metadata for Vascular Plant Surveys – SEADYN Hondo Project

The primary purpose of the SEADYN research project at Hondo-Slave Lake was to document the seasonal dynamic behavior of the Boreal Forest ecosystem based on the quantitative performance of their vascular plant species during the snow-free season (May through October). George La Rio, Mike, and David Chesterman estimated percent cover at monthly intervals in (1) 25-5x5m quadrats in 1981-1985, (2) 10-5x5m quadrats in 1986-90 in each of the 8-50x50m stands. After SEADYN work was completed in October 1990, the project switched to monitoring longer-term, successional changes in the 8 reference stands by sampling all 25 quadrats in each stand in August at 5-year intervals (1995, 2000). In 2001, the Chisholm Fire burned stands 3, 4, 6, and 8. These stands were re-staked and sampled in August and September of 2001. All 8 stands were sampled in 2005, 2010, and 2015. 

Data was cleaned and compiled as part of the Living Data Project by Jenna Loesberg and Ellen Bledsoe in 2021.

###
Methods for data collection: From "Ecological Monitoring Research in Pinus banksiana dominated forests of the Athabasca Oil sands and Hondo-Slave lake areas of Alberta during the period 1981-1984" - this report only included 3 Hondo plots, but methods should have been the same across all of them.

Ocular estimates of the above-ground live shoot cover (ie area of vertical projection of leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits expressed as a fraction of plot area) of each vascular plant species population were made to the nearest 1% or, if < 1%, then "+" for ca. 0.5%, "R" for ca. 0.1%, "." for ca. 0.01%, in each of the 100 5x5 permanent quadrats in the reference stand, using standard survey forms to facilitate entry into computer files. Placement of the sampling units was the same in all reference stands, ie, a systematic arrangement of alternative quadrats (columns A, C, E, G, I) in alternate "survey rows" (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) such that "control rows" 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 were not disturbed by the survey process. See figure for locations. 

Plants need not be rooted in the quadrats to be included in the cover and frequency estimates of the species poulations to which they belong (e.g. proportions of Pinus banksiana tree crowns overhanging the quadrat  were included  in the cover estimate for that sampling unit even thoug the tree was rooted outside of the quadrat). To minimize variations in cover arising from different observers, only three surveyeres estimated vascular plant cover in the project. 
###

Quadrat resurveys:
Some quadrats were survyed by each observer in some years. These are shown as "regular" Quad = 4A, and so on, and the resurveys are Quad = 4A.1, and so on. In the 2020 internship, we decided to average these values into one value for each quad.
###

Soil Temperature:
Methods included: Insert flagging rods into 4 corner PVC pipe, then insert soil thermometers into center of quadrat about 5-10 ?? deep. Let sit while species cover was measured (about 5 minutes). Then probe was removed and read temperature.
When temperature was not recorded, value is "NA". In the raw data files, there is information for which thermometers are used. 
###

Cover and temperature for each stand is saved in seperate files (Hondo_final). 

###
Species codes are explained in the Species_List_Vascular_Surveys.csv file, which is adapted from the 2005 master file compiled in 2005. Older versions of this file are in the Archived species name foler. Columns are:
	Species - code used in stand data
	Strata - functional group (T = tree, F = forb, G = graminoid)
	X7.letter.code - code used in older forms of the file
	sci.name.2005 - scientific name used in 2005
	sci.authority.2005 - scientific authority in 2005
	common.name.2005 - common name used in 2005
	sci.name.2020 - updated scientific name in 2020
	common.name.2020 - updated common name in 2020
	sci.authority.2020 - scientific authority updated in 2020
	comments: any comments made in the 2005 file and comments for unknown species in 2020
	Accepted...Y.N. - whether or not the scientific name is accepted in 2020 (yes or no)
OBSN = Observer number
TEMP = soil temperature; removed during data processing

Data collection notes
Notes from the 2015 field crew (Derek Johnson and Jared Salvail). 
 - Equisetum variegatum could be Equisetum hyemale in some plots, both species are present in stands 1 and 2 but E. hyemale is more common even though they have been all recorded as E. variegatum in the past.
- Anemone multifida and A. patens in jackpine stands hard to distinguish for small plants – the former predominates, so was recorded as A. multifida unless flower stalk remains were visible.
- Oryzopsis asperifolia and Oryzopsis pungens were listed, but latter is characteristic of jack pine stands, former is not. Former was not identified in 2015.
- Petasites palmatus, P. vitifolius, P. sagittatus have been changed to one species, need to be changed to P. frigidus var. palmatus.
- POPA is Potentilla palustris  and POPL is Poa palustris
- Carex rostrata in all years needs to be changed to Carex utriculata (former is found in water bodies)
- Antennaria racemose and Osmorhiza chilensis are likely not right in previous years – they weren’t found in 2015 and former is a western mountain species.
